## How to Use the App

To book, choose a spot with a plus sign (this means its empty). Write your name and choose your interviewer. Click save.

If you want to change your interview time, you can delete your interview and choose a different time slot.

Made a typo? No problem-- you can edit your submission. 

No slots available for the day you want? Use the sidebar to navigate through the different days-- it will also show the spots remaining!
